- It was the first group project in my 42 cursus.
- 42 project, recoding our own little **bash**. A program capable of parsing (which I have done ) a prompt and launching executables with arguments, along with a few built-in functions.
-  The objective of this project is to create a simple shell to learn some advanced programming techniques like processes creation and control, file descriptors, signals and pipes, etc.

# WHY?

The existence of **shells** is linked to the very existence of IT.

At the time, all developers agreed that *communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating.* 

It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to **communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to the human language.** 

Thanks to **Minishell**, you‚Äôll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when ~~Windows~~ didn‚Äôt exist.

| **cd** | Change the shell working directory	(with a relative or absolute path). |
| **pwd** | Print name of current/working directory. |
| **export** | Set export attribute for shell variables. |
| **unset** | Unset values of shell variables. |
| **env** | Print the environment. |
| **exit** | Cause the shell to exit with the exit status specified. |

###  the most highlighted learned skill from this project is "How to fix memory leaks, and memory management".
                                                   We struggled but we learned :)
